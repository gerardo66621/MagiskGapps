# MAGISKGAPPS IS BEING REPLACED BY MAGISKGAPPS MAKER! THIS REPO WILL BE ARCHIVED
MagiskGApps Maker is an online tool that converts a regular GApps package into a MagiskGApps package. 

NikGApps is currently the only supported GApps package. 

Please visit [MagiskGApps.com/maker](https://magiskgapps.com/maker)

# This is the MagiskGApps Creator script
MagiskGApps is bases of Nikgapps @ nikgapps.com . The script converts the Nikgapps package into a Magisk Module. 

## Compatibility:

 * Works on most AOSP based custom roms
 * Works on most AOSP based OEM roms (Motorolla, asus, etc)
 * DOES NOT work on MIUI.
 * May or may not work on bloated stock roms, like oneui, coloros etc. This means you use it at your own risk.

## Why MagiskGApps?

 * MagiskGApps can be uninstalled, meaning it can be installed temporarily
 * It can be used to change other GApps packages previously installed, meaning a device with core gapps can be changed to stock without wiping the data partition
 * Super easy to flash and update
